<h2>About Us</h2>
<p> Kickerz Review was founded by Yusuf Goodman after wanting a place to illustrate his opinions on soccer jerseys world wide. His love for jerseys started at a young age after constanly watching soccer from diffrent regions of the world and noticing not only diffrent style of play, but diffrent jersey designs as well. As a result he started to purchase jerseys from across the globe amassing a little collection for himself. However, Our founder belived that just having a couple of jerseys means nothing if you have no one to talk about it. Thus Kickerz Review was born. </p>
